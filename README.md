## Step by Step Process

#### Step 1: Data Sources

1. Inside the `src` directory, create a folder named `data`  
2. Allocate the data sources for the project:

   - [CoffeeData.ts](./src/data/CoffeeData.ts)  
   - [BeansData.ts](./src/data/BeansData.ts)

---

#### Step 2: Theme Configuration

1. Inside the `src` directory, create a folder named `theme`.  
2. Configure the theme settings for the project:

   - [theme.ts](./src/theme/theme.ts)

---

#### Step 3: Folder Structure

1. Inside the `src` directory, create the following folders:  

   - `components` : for reusable UI components
   - `navigators` : for managing app navigation
   - `store` : for state management library
   - `screens` : for app screens and views

   Example folder structure:

### Final Steps

   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew clean
